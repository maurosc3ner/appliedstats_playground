# Statistical Inferce 
This is my playground repo to consolidate examples in problems I have faced in statistics.


## Frameworks
1. Tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot,purr, among others)
2. Spline regressions (GAMMS)
3. Multilevel models (lme4)
4. Bayes (Rstanarm, brms, and INLA)
4. Tensorflow

## Topics 
1. Logistic models and binomial distribution
2. Count models and poisson distribution
3. Feature engineering
    * Singular Value Decomposition and PCA 
    * UMAP and t-SNE
4. Unservised learning
    * K-Medioids
5. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
6. Time-series forecasting
    * [Arima]()
    * [GAMs]()
7. Spatial Statistics
    * Moran's I
8. Time-to-event analysis
    * Recurrent visits [Bayes and rstanarm](https://maurosc3ner.github.io/bayesian.survival.github.io/)

8. Deep learning
9. Visualization
    * Mapping projection and animation in R ([Notebook](https://github.com/maurosc3ner/uspm25_2000_2018))
    * Bivariate mapping of COVID-19
    * Intro to GIS in R (Cincinnati Children's R Users Group) ([Talk](https://github.com/CCHMC-RUG/intro2GIS_R_CCHMCDec2022))
